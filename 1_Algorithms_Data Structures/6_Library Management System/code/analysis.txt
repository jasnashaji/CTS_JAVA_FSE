Library Management System - Search Algorithms Analysis

1. Linear Search
- Searches each element one by one until the target is found.
- Time Complexity
  - Best Case O(1)
  - AverageWorst Case O(n)
- Works on unsorted data.

2. Binary Search
- Divides the sorted list in half to search for the target.
- Time Complexity
  - Best Case O(1)
  - AverageWorst Case O(log n)
- Requires the array to be sorted beforehand.

3. When to Use
- Use Linear Search
  - When data is unsorted or small in size.
  - Simpler to implement, no sorting overhead.
- Use Binary Search
  - When data is sorted and large in size.
  - Offers significantly faster performance.

Conclusion
Binary search is more efficient for large, sorted datasets, while linear search is flexible for smaller or unsorted collections.
