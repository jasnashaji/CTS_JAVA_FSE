Sorting Customer Orders - Analysis

Sorting algorithms help organize data efficiently. Two commonly used algorithms are Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.

1. Bubble Sort:
- Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if out of order.
- Time Complexity:
  - Best Case: O(n) when already sorted
  - Average & Worst Case: O(n²)
- Simple but slow for large datasets.

2. Quick Sort:
- Uses divide-and-conquer; selects a pivot and partitions the array.
- Time Complexity:
  - Best & Average Case: O(n log n)
  - Worst Case: O(n²) (rare, when pivot is always worst choice)
- Efficient for large data and widely used in practice.

Comparison:
- Bubble Sort is easy to implement but inefficient.
- Quick Sort is faster and better suited for sorting large customer order lists.

Conclusion:
Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort in real-world applications due to its speed and scalability.
