Task Management System - Analysis

1. Linked List Overview:
- Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node only.
- Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both previous and next nodes.

2. Time Complexity:
- Add Task: O(n) (inserting at the end by traversing)
- Search Task: O(n)
- Traverse Tasks: O(n)
- Delete Task: O(n)

3. Advantages of Linked List over Array:
- Dynamic size: No need to predefine capacity.
- Easy insertions/deletions (especially at the beginning or middle).
- Efficient use of memory (no unused space like arrays).

4. When to Use:
- When frequent insertions/deletions are required.
- When the size of data is unknown or changes frequently.

Conclusion:
Singly linked lists offer efficient memory usage and flexibility, making them ideal for task management where tasks are added or removed often.
