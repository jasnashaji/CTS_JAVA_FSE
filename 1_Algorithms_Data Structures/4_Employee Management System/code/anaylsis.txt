Employee Management System - Analysis

1. Array Representation in Memory:
- Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Each element is accessed via an index, allowing O(1) time for access.
- Arrays are fixed in size and must be declared with a known capacity.

2. Time Complexity of Operations:
- Add: O(1) (if space is available)
- Search: O(n) (linear scan)
- Traverse: O(n)
- Delete: O(n) (shift elements after deletion)

3. Limitations of Arrays:
- Fixed size: Can't grow dynamically.
- Insertion and deletion are expensive (O(n) time) due to shifting.
- Waste of memory if size is too large.

4. When to Use Arrays:
- When the number of records is known and small.
- When fast access (random index) is needed.
- When memory overhead must be minimal.

In large or dynamic systems, ArrayList or LinkedList may be more appropriate due to their flexibility.
