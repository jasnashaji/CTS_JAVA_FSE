Financial Forecasting - Recursive Algorithm Analysis

1. Concept of Recursion:
- Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller subproblem.
- It simplifies problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems (e.g., predicting compound growth year-by-year).

2. Recursive Method Used:
- predictValue(initialValue, growthRate, years):
  This function recursively multiplies the current value by (1 + growthRate) for each year.

3. Time Complexity:
- Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of years.
- Each recursive call reduces the number of years by 1 until it reaches 0.

4. Optimization:
- The current implementation is efficient (linear) and doesnâ€™t require memoization.
- However, if the prediction involved overlapping subproblems (like in Fibonacci), memoization or iteration would be necessary to optimize.

5. When to Use Recursion:
- Useful for problems with a clear base case and smaller subproblems.
- Be cautious with deep recursion, as it can lead to stack overflow if not bounded.

Conclusion:
The recursive approach simplifies the logic of financial prediction and is efficient for moderate time periods.
